I'm Omaël, a CS novice from Québec, Canada

🎓 Currently completing a DEC in Informatics at Cégep de Valleyfield

💼 Currently working for a small tech company under a government contract, 
maintaining and repairing RAIC (Restricted Area Identity Card) devices for CATSA

🛠️ In parallel, I run a small independent business where I handle a bit of everything; from computer troubleshooting to recycling and reselling refurbished Cisco VoIP phones.
