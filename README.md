## Hey hey (≧∇≦)ﾉ


I'm Omaël, a CS novice from Québec, Canada

💼 Currently working for a small technology company under a government contract, 
maintaining and repairing RAIC (Restricted Area Identity Card) devices for CATSA 
(Canadian Air Transport Security Authority).

🛠️ In parallel, I run a small independent business where I handle a bit of everything—from electronics repair to recycling and reselling refurbished Cisco VoIP phones.
